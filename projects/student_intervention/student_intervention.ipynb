    "- Simple to understand and to interpret. Trees can be visualised.\n",
    "- Requires little data preparation. Other techniques often require data normalisation, dummy variables need to be created and blank values to be removed. Note however that this module does not support missing values.\n",
    "- The cost of using the tree (i.e., predicting data) is logarithmic in the number of data points used to train the tree.\n",
    "- Able to handle both numerical and categorical data. Other techniques are usually specialised in analysing datasets that have only one type of variable. See algorithms for more information.\n",
    "- Able to handle multi-output problems.\n",
    "- Uses a white box model. If a given situation is observable in a model, the explanation for the condition is easily explained by boolean logic. By contrast, in a black box model (e.g., in an artificial neural network), results may be more difficult to interpret.\n",
    "- Possible to validate a model using statistical tests. That makes it possible to account for the reliability of the model.\n",
    "- Performs well even if its assumptions are somewhat violated by the true model from which the data were generated.\n",
    "\n",
    "The disadvantages of decision trees include*:\n",
    "- Decision-tree learners can create over-complex trees that do not generalise the data well. This is called overfitting. Mechanisms such as pruning (not currently supported), setting the minimum number of samples required at a leaf node or setting the maximum depth of the tree are necessary to avoid this problem.\n",
    "- Decision trees can be unstable because small variations in the data might result in a completely different tree being generated. This problem is mitigated by using decision trees within an ensemble.\n",
    "- The problem of learning an optimal decision tree is known to be NP-complete under several aspects of optimality and even for simple concepts. Consequently, practical decision-tree learning algorithms are based on heuristic algorithms such as the greedy algorithm where locally optimal decisions are made at each node. Such algorithms cannot guarantee to return the globally optimal decision tree. This can be mitigated by training multiple trees in an ensemble learner, where the features and samples are randomly sampled with replacement.\n",
    "- There are concepts that are hard to learn because decision trees do not express them easily, such as XOR, parity or multiplexer problems.\n",
    "- Decision tree learners create biased trees if some classes dominate. It is therefore recommended to balance the dataset prior to fitting with the decision tree.\n",

    "In random forests, each tree in the ensemble is built from a sample drawn with replacement (i.e., a bootstrap sample) from the training set. In addition, when splitting a node during the construction of the tree, the split that is chosen is no longer the best split among all features. Instead, the split that is picked is the best split among a random subset of the features. As a result of this randomness, the bias of the forest usually slightly increases (with respect to the bias of a single non-random tree) but, due to averaging, its variance also decreases, usually more than compensating for the increase in bias, hence yielding an overall better model.\n",

    "Random Forest (0.8112) > Decision Tree (0.7914) > SVM (0.7862). \n",
    "\n",
    "For comparison NB F1 is 0.75 (no grid search).\n",
    "\n",
    "Given accuracy results I'd drop NB. Given that SVM is higher in compuational complexity compared to Decision Tree (see results section 4), I'd drop SVM. Another drawback of SVMs is their black box nature. That means results cannot be easily interpreted.\n",
    "\n",
    "That leaves Decision Trees and Random Forests. Random Forests are about 2% more accurate. But they do have higher computational complexity M * sqrt(F) > F. They also make interpretation of results a bit harder.\n",

    "In summary, I'd choose Decision Trees. They are fast, easy to interpret and sufficiently accurate.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works:\n",
    "\n",
    "A tree can be learned by splitting the source set into subsets based on a feature value test, e.g information gain. This process is repeated on each derived subset in a recursive manner. The recursion is completed when the subset at a node has all the same value of the target variable, or when splitting no longer adds value to the predictions. This process of top-down induction of decision trees is an example of a greedy algorithm, and it is by far the most common strategy for learning decision trees from data.*\n",
